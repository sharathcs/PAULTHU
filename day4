 Array is collection of same data type elements

7.
 Array index is the position of array elements starting from 0 to n-1.

8.
Each and every variable is to be declared in case of using n variables which is time consuming ,whereas in arrays we can declare n variables at a time .

9
No we cant. 

10.
For loop is used for iterating a particular condition and executing a set of statements.

11
.For loops are normally used when we need a command to iterate again and again for n number of times.

12
.It should be a countable set of numbers and should be in ordered pair thatâ€™s why integer is used as array index always.

13.
 X = x+10 in a for(i=0;i<10;i++) means iterating the same program for the 10 times i.e, x will be added by 10 for the 10 times.

14
.Only one time, i=0 is executed at the entrance of for loop.

15.
 i<n is executed for n times as to check the condition if it is true or not. If the condition will be true then, it will go inside the for loop.

16.
 I++ is executed n-1 times as the increment operator in for loop for changing the values of i.
