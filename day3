1:-Write a program to get two integers from the user and print the sum of the two integers?
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    int a,b;
    printf("enter two numbers:");
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
    
    printf("the sum of two numbers:%d",(a+b));
}



2:-Write a function to add two integers. 
#include<stdio.h>
int sum(int a, int b);
void main()
{
    int a,b,add;
    printf("\n enter the numbers:");
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
    
    add=sum(a,b);
    printf("sum=%d",add);
    
}

int sum(int a,int b)
{
    int add;
    add=a+b;
    return add;
}






3:-Write a program to get two float from the user and print the sum of the two float?
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{
    float a,b;
    printf("enter two numbers:");
    scanf("%f%f",&a,&b);
    
    printf("%f",a+b);
}


4:-Write a function to add two float.
#include<stdio.h>
float sum(float a,float b);
void main()
{
    float a,b,add;
    printf("enter the numbers:");
    scanf("%f%f",&a,&b);
    
    add=sum(a,b);
    printf("total=%f",add);
    
}

float sum(float a,float b)
{
    float result;
    result=a+b;
    return result;
}




5:-Write a function to compare 2 numbers and test it.
#include<stdio.h>
int compare(int a,int b);
void main()
{
    int a,b,large;
    printf("enter the numbers:");
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
    
    large=compare(a,b);
    printf("largest=%d",large);
    
}

int compare(int a,int b)
{
    if(a>b)
    return a;
    else
    return b;
}






6:-Write a function to compare 3 numbers and test it.
#include<stdio.h>
int compare(int a,int b,int c);
void main()
{
    int a,b,c,large;
    printf("enter the numbers:");
    scanf("%d%d%d",&a,&b,&c);
    
    large=compare(a,b,c);
    printf("largest=%d",large);
    
}

int compare(int a,int b,int c)
{
    if(a>b && a>c)
    return a;
    if(b>a && b>c)
    return b;
    else
    return c;
}


7:-What is the structure of a program?
It consist of functions
Userdefined functions
Standard library functions
Main function

8:-What is the difference between %d and %f format specifiers?
 %d format specifier is used to read an integer from the user while %f is used for reading floating or decimal values input from the user.

9:-What is a function?
A function is a segment that groups code to perform a specific task

10:-What is a function definition?
Function definition is declaring the function name, parameters and return type

11:-What is a function declaration?
A function declaration tells the compiler about a function name and how to call the function


12:-Why do you need function declaration?
To let the compiler know about the user defined function.


13:-What are the formal parameters?
Formal parameters are used to declare some variables that exists in the function

14:-What are the actual parameters?
Actual parameters are the variables that contains the value which we have to compute in the function.

15:-What is the meaning of pass by value?
If data is passed by value, the data is copied from the variable used in for example main() to a variable used by the function.


16:-What is the meaning of pass by reference?
If data is passed by reference, a pointer to the data is copied instead of the actual variable as is done in a call by value.



17:-List all syntax errors and reason for the syntax errors.
Syntax Errors:=
Missing Parenthesis (})
Printing the value of variable without declaring it
Missing semicolon


18:-What is the meaning of floating point number?
Floating point numbers means that there is no fixed number of digits before and after the decimal point that is, the decimal point can float


19:-Is there a limit to how big an integer can be me in c program?
It depends on the size of your system.

20:-Is there a limit to how big a floating point number can be in a c program?
-3.4E+38 to +3.4E+38
